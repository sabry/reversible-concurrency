the_example.hs contains all the code to run the one example listed in
the proposal that tests all the features in the model so far. That is,
it contains the example from section 2 of the proposal, and does run it,
though incorrectly.

The other files incrementally build up the model, in the same order as
the proposal.

I have a feeling my scheduler is not implemented in the best way, but it
does seem to work on the first couple models. It fails slightly in the
final example, and I while understand how it's failing, I don't
understand enough to fix it.
