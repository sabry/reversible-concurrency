  ;; Expressions: 
  ;;
  ;;   choose: Creates a choice point, taking the first expression, and
  ;;   saving a continuation. If the thread backtracks to this choice
  ;;   point, it uses the second expression.
  ;;   
  ;;   par: Executes two expressions in parallel.
  ;;
  ;;   newChan: Creates a new channel. Channels are assumed to have a
  ;;   single sender and single receiver. XXX: I haven't formalized that
  ;;
  ;;   backtrack: Returns to the last choice point, and causes all
  ;;   threads which have communicated with the current thread to
  ;;   backtrack to a specific time.
  ;;
  ;;   send: Sends a value on a channel. Currently synchronous, but
  ;;   should be easy to modify to make synchronous.
  ;;
  ;;   recv: Receives a value on a channel.
  ;;
  ;;   seq: Sequencing. Not particularly necessary, but useful since
  ;;   much of the language is stateful.
