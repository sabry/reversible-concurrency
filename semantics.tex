\section{Syntax} 

\paragraph*{Ids.} Each process has an id $n$ and each channel has an id
$\ell$.

\paragraph*{Time.} Each process and each channel maintain a \emph{virtual
  time} which is an indication of how far they have progressed in the
evaluation. If process $n$ is at virtual $t$, this is indicated by $n@t$. The
virtual times evolve independently and may be inconsistent globally. However
whenever a communication event happens, the virtual times of all involved
parties (the sender process, the receiver process, and the communication
channel) are all synchronized and brought to a consistent state.

\paragraph*{Channels.} Processes communicate via named channels. Each channel
is associated with exactly two processes: a sender and a receiver. A channel
maintains a flag indicating if both attached processes are going forward
(flag is $F$) or if at least one of them has backtracked (flag is $B$). A
channel also maintains a virtual time which roughly corresponds to the time
of the latest communication on that channel. A process $n_1$ whose virtual
time is $t_1$ can only send or receive on a channel with virtual time $t_c$
if $t_1 \geq t_c$ and the channel flag is $F$. If the channel flag is $B$,
this means that the process at the other end has backtracked and hence that
process $n$ should backtrack to a time $\leq t_c$. It should never be the
case that a channel with flag $F$ has a time ahead of its associated
processes. The current timestamps on channels are maintained in a
\emph{global} map $\Xi$. A process who id is $n$ can however only ``see'' the
part of the map that refers to its channels: we refer to this part as
$\Xi\downarrow n$.

\paragraph*{Communication Model.} We focus on \emph{synchronous}
channel-based communication. The model supports \emph{choice}: the expression
$\recv{x_1}{\ell_1}{x_2}{\ell_2}$ can receive a message on either channel
$\ell_1$ or $\ell_2$. If both choices are offered, the evaluation of the
expression is permitted to choose which one to accept. 

\paragraph*{Processes.} A process computes forward and backwards sending and
receiving messages. To enable distributed backtracking, each process maintain
a virtual time $t$ and a stack $\Gamma$ of contexts. Each context includes a
conventional continuation (a control point and an environment), a time stamp,
and a channel map describing the state of the communication channels at the
time of the checkpoint. (Only the portion of the channel map specific to the
process needs to be saved but we save the entire channel map for simplicity.)

\section{Semantics} 

\begin{itemize}
\item The first rule just applies a local evaluation rule to one of the
  running processes. The remaining processes, the global channel map, the
  local timestamp, and the local stack of contexts are all left
  untouched. (We only increase the timestamp for ``relevant'' rules which
  involve communication.)
\[\begin{array}{rcl}
  \Xi,\parc{p}{\proc{n}{\Gamma}{E[(\lambda x.e)~v]}{t}} &\mapsto& 
  \Xi,\parc{p}{\proc{n}{\Gamma}{E[e[v/x]]}{t}}
\end{array}\]

\item This next rule says that if we have a channel $\ell$ and two processes
  with timestamps $t_1$ and $t_2$ who wish to communicate using this channel,
  the communication only happens if both process timestamps are greater than
  or equal to the channel timestamp and the channel has a flag $F$. After the
  communication, all three timestamps are updated to some number that is
  greater than or equal to their maximum:
\[\begin{array}{l}
  \Xi_1,\parc{p}
  {\parc{\proc{n_1}{\Gamma_1}{E_1[\send{\ell}{v}]}{t_1}}
        {\proc{n_2}{\Gamma_2}{E_2[\recv{x}{\ell}{x'}{\ell'}]}{t_2}}}
  \mapsto \\
  \Xi_2,\parc{p}{\parc{\proc{n_1}{\Gamma_1}{E_1[()]}{t}}
    {\proc{n_2}{\Gamma_2}{E_2[v]}{t}}}
\end{array}\]
if $(\ell,(t_{c},F,n_1,n_2)) \in \Xi_1$, the original channel map, and $t_1,t_2
\geq t_c$. The entry for $\ell$ in the resulting channel map 
$\Xi_2$ is $(t,F,n_1,n_2)$ for some $t \geq t_1, t_2, t_c$.

\item The next two rules deal with stable regions. When a new stable region
  is encountered, the evaluation increments the timestamp and saves a new
  context, which is restored should the evaluation backtrack within the
  dynamic extent of the stable region:
\[\begin{array}{rcl}
  \Xi,\parc{p}{\proc{n}{\Gamma}{E[(\stable{(\lambda x.e)})~v]}{t}} &\mapsto&
  \Xi,\parc{p}{\proc{n}{\Gamma'}{E[\stableu{e[v/x]}]}{(t+1)}} 
\end{array}\]
where $\Gamma' = \Gamma,(E,(t+1),\Xi)$. When the body of a stable 
region terminates with a value, we simply pop the context:
\[\begin{array}{rcl}
  \Xi,\parc{p}{\proc{n}{\Gamma,(E,t',\Xi')}{E[\stableu{v}]}{t}} 
  &\mapsto& 
  \Xi,\parc{p}{\proc{n}{\Gamma}{E[v]}{t}} 
\end{array}\]

\item The next rule shows what happens when we backtrack. In that case, we
  recover the saved state of the channels and resume execution from the saved
  time with the saved continuation:
\[\begin{array}{rcl}
  \Xi,\parc{p}{\proc{n}{\Gamma,(E',t',\Xi')}{E[\backtrack{v}]}{t}} 
  &\mapsto& 
  (\Xi\uplus(\Xi'\downarrow n)^\dagger),\parc{p}{\proc{n}{\Gamma}{E'[v]}{t'}} 
\end{array}\]
In this rule, it is important to realize that process $n$ only updates the 
part of the global map $\Xi$ that involves $n$. Otherwise, the progress 
by other unrelated channels would be lost. The $\dagger$ indicates that channels 
flagged with $B$ need to be updated to $F$ if the new time $t'$ is less than their
virtual times. In other words, if process $n$ has backtracked as far as one of
its communicating partners, the corresponding channel becomes available again 
for communication. 

\item The next two rules deal with the situation in which one of the
  processes has backtracked but its communication partner has not. In this
  first rule, the sender needs to backtrack:
\[\begin{array}{l}
  \Xi,
  \parc{p}{\proc{n_1}{\Gamma}{E[\send{\ell}{v}]}{t_1}} \mapsto \\
  \Xi,
  \parc{p}{\proc{n_1}{\Gamma}{E[\backtrack{()}; \send{\ell}{v}]}{t_1}}
\end{array}\]
if $(\ell,(t_c,B,n_1,n_2)) \in \Xi_1$, the original channel map indicating
that $n_2$ has backtracked to a time consistent with $t_c$ and hence that
$n_1$ should do the same. We achieve this by executing $\backtrack{()}$ which
moves to the most recent saved context and attempts to re-execute the
communication.  If that fails, this same rule applies and we backtrack again.
There is a symmetric rule for receivers.

\end{itemize}
